I’m an embedded systems engineer at ElectronicCats and Pwnlab, specializing in low-level firmware development, hardware exploitation, and space systems security. Most of my work focuses on understanding how embedded systems really operate at the lowest levels—so I can analyze them, break them, and ultimately make them more secure.

I lead PWNSAT, a project dedicated to building intentionally vulnerable CubeSats for hands-on satellite cybersecurity training, and I’m the architect of FlatSat, an educational platform designed to teach practical embedded hardware hacking through real-world scenarios.

My research explores practical attack surfaces in satellite subsystems and embedded radio communications, with a strong emphasis on offensive, applied security. I’ve delivered trainings at international security conferences such as Ekoparty, and I’m committed to advancing offensive research across the aerospace and IoT hacking domains.
